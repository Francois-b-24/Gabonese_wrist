Welcome to my blog dedicated to the world of watchmaking !

As an enthusiast of the history of watchmaking and fine timepieces, I would like to share my vision and knowledge in this field with you. We will address the topic as follows :

-   We will talk about the main watch manufacturers such as Rolex, Omega, Cartier, Tudor, etc. We will retrace the evolution of practices, know-how and technological innovations in the field of watchmaking.

-   We will also address the subject from a quantitative point of view. Through data analysis, we will examine the characteristics of luxury watches in the second-hand market. We will also explain how the specificities of each watch can influence their value.

-   I will share and propose sheets on the models I will try.
